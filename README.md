# What is BuriedPipe?

BuriedPipe is a 2D Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation application designed to model a pipe surrounded by granular particles within a periodic cell. It focuses on simulating a pipe embedded in a granular packing composed of disks, enabling researchers to study the behavior of granular materials and their interactions with buried structures.

# Getting Started

To install, compile, and run simulations, follow the instructions in the short [documentation](DOC.md).

# Credits

BuriedPipe was initiated as part of an internship by Jesus Da Silva, under the supervision of Christophe Dano and Vincent Richefeu at Laboratoire 3SR.
